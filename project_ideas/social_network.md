# Social Network

The main concept is to create a social network with standart functions and some unique features.
For example, it could be an ability to use markdown for posting, or built-in editor and viewer
of math formulas for IM and posts.

## Pros

- Quite interesting;
- Can easily be decomposed into smaller subtasks that can be done almost independently;
- It's not an internet shop.

## Cons

- But it's a web-site;
- Can require much time to implement;
- Features beyond the basic functionality are not simple ones.

## Languages and technologies

- Frontend: layout, JS, mb a js framework;
- Backend: Python + Django, i think
- Project may require some build system. If it will, we'll probably use Gulp (becase we have collaborators at different platforms)
