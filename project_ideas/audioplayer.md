# Audioplayer

Simple audioplayer with default features.

## Pros

- Easy to implement;
- Can be tear apart after some architecturing;
- Not a website;
- Not an internet shop;
- If using supposed technologies, we can use the Awesome ES6 without any fuck with transpilers.

## Cons

- Tons of different audioplayers in the world, but who cares? Why don't we create another one?

## Languages and tools

- Electron framework (with node.js as a dependency);
- Obviously, html + js for electron.

## Planned features

- The first and the greatest, - the player will be completely crossplatform (for desktops, at least)!
- An ability to change skins just with changing attached stylesheet;
- Several playlists, playback queue;
- Other standart features, including equalizer and effects;
- Remote control, if enabled;
- Mb some social stuff
- Ability to download music from any url, plugins for downloading from vk
- Online broadcasting

The task promises to be quite interesting and challenging, but can easily be performed in na-otyebis-style
(about 20 man-hours with some huyak-huyak architecture and working basic features).
