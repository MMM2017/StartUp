# Messenger

A simple messenger for teams, like Slack.

## Pros

- Freedom in what technology and language to pick up (at least at frontend);
- Easy decompositable, making it easier to implement in team;
- Beyond the core, there are a lot of independent features that can be assigned
  to different people and done in parallel: if one team-feature fails, other can
  continue working.

## Cons

- Seems to be not an easy task;
- Lots of messengers today, and we're going into mainstream;
- Is harder inside than it seems from outside.

## Planned features

- Instant messaging (R U RLY?);
- Common team chat, subteam chats, personal messages;
- Different types of attachments:
	- images
	- videos
	- audios
	- files
	- documents
	- snippets
	- locations
	- objects
	- memes
	- whatever

When the idea may seem a good and easy one, I think we need at least ~30 man-hours to build a core
(only messaging, no attachments, no sub-team chats, the only team can exist per server).
